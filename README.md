DayZ Prometheus Metrics Exporter is a powerful, cross-platform solution for
collecting and publishing metrics from DayZ servers, supporting all major
operating systems. It offers a ready-to-use Container image for easy deployment
and provides full GeoIP support for player geolocation. The exporter
collects data via Battleye RCON and Steam A2S Query, offering insights into
server status, online players, bans, and more. Best of all, it requires no
mods to be installed on the server. With fast setup, flexibility, and
scalability, it's the perfect tool for monitoring DayZ servers in any
environment.

## Configuration

```txt
Usage:
  ./dayz-exporter [option] [config.yaml]

Available options:
  -y, --get-yaml    Prints an example YAML configuration file.
  -e, --get-env     Prints an example .env file.
  -v, --version     Show version, commit, and build time.
  -h, --help        Prints this help message.
```

Run the program with a custom configuration file:

```bash
./dayz-exporter config.yaml
```

Configuration File Lookup:

* The program first checks for a configuration file specified by the
  variable `DAYZ_EXPORTER_CONFIG_PATH`.
* If the config variable is not set, it will attempt to use a configuration
  file passed as a command-line argument.
* If no argument is provided, it will attempt to read from the default
  file `config.yaml` in the current directory.

You can get a sample YAML configuration here [example.config.yaml], or
save a sample YAML configuration to a file from within the application
itself by running:

```bash
./dayz-exporter --get-yaml > config.yaml
```

You can get a sample of environment variables here [example.env], or
save to a file from within the application itself by running:

```bash
./dayz-exporter --get-env > dayz-exporter.env
```

YAML configuration options take priority over environment variables.
If you use both, comment out the options in YAML that you wish to override
using environment variables.

```bash
DAYZ_EXPORTER_RCON_PASSWORD=strong %[1]s config.yaml
```

For more information on configuration parameters, refer to the example
configuration files (YAML and .env).

## Metrics

Metrics collected using the A2S INFO protocol provide information about
players online, server status, etc., and a list of tags is generated.  
Metrics collected by Battleye RCON provide detailed information about
each player or entry in the ban list.

## Endpoints

The DayZ exporter exposes several useful endpoints for monitoring and troubleshooting:

* `/`: Provides an overview of the exporter and includes useful information
  about the status of the service, the connected game server,
  and the exporter version.
* `/metrics`: Exposes Prometheus-compatible metrics. This is the main endpoint
  used by Prometheus to scrape metrics from the exporter. It is typically
  accessed by your Prometheus instance for metric collection.
* `/health`: A general health check of the service. It provides an
  overall status of the exporter.
* `/health/liveness`: A liveness check endpoint that verifies if the
  service is alive. This checks the RCON connection to ensure the
  exporter is functioning.
* `/health/readiness`: A readiness check endpoint that ensures the service
  is fully operational, i.e., all required connections (like RCON and Steam)
  are established and functional.

## Setup Exporter

### Container Image

The images are published to two container registries:

* [`docker pull ghcr.io/woozymasta/dayz-exporter:latest`][ghcr]
* [`docker pull docker.io/woozymasta/dayz-exporter:latest`][docker]

Quick start:

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull ghcr.io/woozymasta/dayz-exporter:latest
# Generate an example YAML config
docker run --rm -ti ghcr.io/woozymasta/dayz-exporter:latest --get-yaml > dayz-exporter.yaml
# Edit the config file
editor dayz-exporter.yaml
# Run the container with the mounted config and exposed port
docker run --name dayz-exporter -d \
  -v "$PWD/dayz-exporter.yaml:/config.yaml" -p 8098:8098 \
  ghcr.io/woozymasta/dayz-exporter:latest
```

You can also use environment variables instead of a configuration file
by running `--get-env` to get an example and passing them
as container environment variables.

> [!TIP]  
> When running in Kubernetes or other container orchestrators, use
> `/health/liveness` and `/health/readiness` endpoints to check the
> health and readiness of the containerized application.

### Systemd service

To run the DayZ exporter as a systemd service, use the following example
configuration. This ensures the exporter runs on system startup.

```ini
[Unit]
Description=DayZ Prometheus Metrics Exporter
Documentation=https://woozymasta.github.io/dayz-exporter/
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target dayz-server.target

[Service]
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/dayz-exporter.env
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dayz-exporter
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

> [!WARNING]  
> Do not use the `root` user for production environments.
> It's recommended to create a dedicated user for this purpose.

Save this as `/etc/systemd/system/dayz-exporter.service`
and enable it using

```bash
systemctl enable dayz-exporter
systemctl start dayz-exporter
```

#### Systemd `--user` multiple servers<!-- omit in toc -->

You can also use a user-specific systemd service, for example, located
in `~/.config/systemd/user/dayz-server@.service`. This allows you to manage
multiple instances of the application simultaneously under the same user.

In this example, one service manages multiple server instances. Ensure
that the `%i` argument is added symmetrically to the server launch
parameters to map ports correctly.

```ini
[Unit]
Description=DayZ Prometheus Metrics Exporter 'Server %I'
Documentation=https://woozymasta.github.io/dayz-exporter/
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target dayz-server@%i.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=%h/dayz/
EnvironmentFile=-%h/.dayz-exporter.env
Environment="DAYZ_EXPORTER_LISTEN_PORT=809%i"
Environment="DAYZ_EXPORTER_QUERY_PORT=2702%i"
Environment="DAYZ_EXPORTER_RCON_PORT=230%i5"
ExecStart=%h/.local/bin/dayz-exporter
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

### Windows service

You can run the exporter using any method that suits you, but it's
recommended to use a Windows service for better management and reliability.

To register the service, assuming the application and configuration are
already downloaded and set up in the `C:\dayz-exporter` directory,
use the following commands:

```powershell
sc.exe create dayz-exporter `
  binPath= "C:\dayz-exporter\dayz-exporter.exe C:\dayz-exporter\config.yaml" `
  DisplayName= "DayZ metrics exporter" `
  start= auto

sc.exe start dayz-exporter
sc.exe query dayz-exporter
```

> [!TIP]  
> You can specify a more descriptive `DisplayName`, especially if you have
> multiple servers or exporters running, to make management easier.

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8098/> in your browser to check if the service is
running properly.

#### Removing a Windows Service<!-- omit in toc -->

```powershell
sc.exe stop dayz-exporter
sc.exe query dayz-exporter
sc.exe delete dayz-exporter
```

## Collect metrics

Ensure that you have a running Prometheus instance to collect metrics from
the DayZ exporter.

To configure Prometheus, add the following job to your `prometheus.yml` file:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: dayz
    # scrape_interval: 1m
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - '<DAYZ_EXPORTER_HOST>:8091'
        - '<DAYZ_EXPORTER_HOST>:8092'
        - '<DAYZ_EXPORTER_HOST>:8093'
```

Replace `<DAYZ_EXPORTER_HOST>` with the IP or hostname of your DayZ exporter
instance.

> [!TIP]  
> By default, Prometheus collects metrics every 15 seconds. However, this
> frequency can be too high, especially for game-related metrics, and may
> increase the amount of data stored. Consider adjusting the scrape interval
> to a longer period (e.g., 1 minute) if the default frequency is not necessary.

### Optional: Process Exporter<!-- omit in toc -->

If you wish to collect resource utilization metrics (e.g., CPU, memory) for
your DayZ servers, and also populate the uptime panel in Grafana, you can
use the optional [process-exporter]. This will collect and expose
additional metrics to Prometheus.

Once the process exporter is installed and configured, it will collect
and expose resource metrics to Prometheus. It will also provide additional
data that will be displayed in the Grafana dashboard.

Example configuration for the process exporter to collect DayZ server
process metrics:

```yaml
process_names:
  - name: "dayz-{{.Matches.ConfigName}}-{{.Matches.Port}}"
    exe:
      - "DayZServer"
    cmdline:
      - '-config=(.*\/)?(?P<ConfigName>.*)\.cfg'
      - '-port=(.*\/)?(?P<Port>[0-9]+)'
```

Don't forget to also add metrics collection with process-exporter
to `scrape_configs` in Prometheus.

## Visualize in Grafana

To visualize the collected metrics, you'll need a running Grafana instance.

* **Main Dashboard**: Import the main dashboard from the file [dayz-rcon.json]
  or by ID [22457] from the Grafana dashboards.  
  This dashboard will display key metrics, such as player counts and other
  relevant information.

* Optional: **Process Exporter Dashboard**: If you have set up the process
  exporter, import the additional dashboard from [system-process.json] or
  by ID [22458] from the Grafana dashboards.  
  This dashboard provides insights into resource utilization
  (CPU, memory, etc.) for your DayZ servers.
